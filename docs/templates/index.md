# Templates

The Refarch templates provide starter files for web application projects based on the reference architecture of it@M.

The templates allow us to:

1. ðŸš€ Accelerate project setup: With repository templates, new projects are kick-started in no time! Pre-configured with essential files and folder structures, these templates eliminate the repetitive setup tasks, allowing developers to focus on business logic.
2. ðŸ’Ž Achieve consistent code quality: By establishing best practices for a unified structure and including helpful development tools, code consistency and quality is maintained across the organization as best as possible and collaboration is improved.
3. ðŸ‘¥ Simplify onboarding: With clear documentation and predefined development configurations, new developers can quickly get up to speed, reducing the learning curve and increasing productivity from day one.

The code for the templates is maintained under a different repository than the rest of the RefArch code. This is because the templates are used a template repository in GitHub and thus need to be in its separate location.
You can find the code for the templates in the [refarch-templates repository](https://github.com/it-at-m/refarch-templates).

::: info Information
All path references you find in the following documentation for the templates are always in relation to the [refarch-templates repository](https://github.com/it-at-m/refarch-templates) (if not stated differently).
