# RefArch Gateway

RefArch gateway based on [Spring Cloud Gateway](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud-gateway).

## Usage

The gateway is released as container image `ghcr.io/it-at-m/refarch/refarch-gateway` and can be used either directly or
via the corresponding [Helm-Chart](https://github.com/it-at-m/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/refarch-gateway).

## Features

Beside the default functionality of Spring Cloud Gateway (i.e. routing) following features are preconfigured/provided:

- OAuth 2.0 based login
- Route protection
- CSRF protection with whitelist
- Cookie to JWT mapping for session management
- Health and metrics endpoints

### Routing

Routes are configured via environment variables as listed under [Configuration](#configuration).

By default, routes require authentication through oAuth2 and manage the session between the client and gateway using
cookies.
The gateway then maps the session cookie to a JWT before routing it.

Beside the default behaviour there are some special route prefixes which are handled different:

- `/public/**`: All `OPTIONS` and `GET` requests are routed without security.
- `/clients/**`: Uses JWT for authenticating incoming requests instead of session cookies.

## Profiles

| Profile           | Description                                                                                       |

| `no-security`     | Disables complete security like authentication, authorization, csrf etc. Routing works as normal. |
| `hazelcast-local` | Configures Spring Session Hazelcast for connection via localhost (i.e. local development).        |

### Security

For authentication via SSO, OAuth2 needs to be configured.
See following example or the [according Spring documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/servlet/oauth2/index.html).

Alternatively the `no-security` profile can be used.

```yaml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: "https://sso.example/auth/realms/example"
      client:
        provider:
          sso:
            issuer-uri: ${spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri}
        registration:
          sso:
            provider: sso
            client-id: 
            client-secret:
            # needed for userInfo endpoint
            scope: profile, openid
```
